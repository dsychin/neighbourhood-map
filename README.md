# Neighbourhood Map Project
## Description
This project uses the Google Maps Javascript API and Foursquare API to show a 
map with a list of fixed locations that shows up as markers on the map. The 
locations can be filtered using the input on the sidebar. Clicking on a 
location on the list or the map will show an info window on the place.

A live demo of this project is available at: https://www.desmondchin.com/neighbourhood-map/
